[Expands to your Miranda path (e.g., c:\\program files\\miranda ng).]

[Expands to your profile path - the value found in mirandaboot.ini,]

[ProfileDir section (usually inside Miranda's folder).]

[Expands to your current profile name without the extenstion.]

[(e.g., default if your your profile is default.dat).]

[Environment variables]

[The plugin can also expand environment variables; the variables are specified like in any other]

[program that can use environment variables, i.e., %<env variable>%.]

[Note: Environment variables are expanded before any Miranda variables. So if you have, for]

[example, %profile_path% defined as a system variable then it will be expanded to that value]

[instead of expanding to Miranda's profile path.]

[Examples:]

[If the value for the ProfileDir inside mirandaboot.ini, ProfileDir section is '.\\profiles\\', current]

[profile is 'default.dat' and Miranda path is 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\' then:]

[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng']

[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles']

[will expand to 'default']

[will expand to the temp folder of the current user.]

[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles\\default']

The string specifies a string in the line to start/end copying.\r\n\r\ncsv(seperatorX) explained...\r\nSeperator is either "tab" or "space" or any SINGLE character. X is the Xth separator to pass before copying, (or to stop before).\r\n\r\nLastly the line(...) variable...\r\nInside the brackets must be either a number (to specify the line number), or a string inside " marks (to use the line with that string), or lastline(X). The X in lastline is the Xth line above the last line, i.e., lastline(1) will use the 2nd last line of the file. If searching for a line with "some words" you may put a + or - X after the closing ), i.e., line("some words")+3 to go 3 lines after the line with "some words".\r\n\r\nSome examples...\r\nfilename(0)    <- will display the filename of the 0th file\r\nfile(0)wholeline(line(0)))    <- will display the whole first line of the 0th file\r\nfile(0)wholeline(line("hello")-1)))    <- the wholeline above the first occurrence of "hello" in the file\r\nfile(0)start(line(lastline(1))csv(tab2))end(line(lastline())csv(tab4)))    <- starts at the 2nd last line of the file, from the 2nd tab variable, until the 4th tab variable in the last line (in the 0th file)\r\nfile(0)start(line("hello")+1"zzzz")end(line(6)17))    <- starts from the first occurrence of zzzz in the line after the first occurrence of hello, until the 17th character in the 6th line (starting from line 0) of the 0th file.\r\n]

[No more spam! Robots can't go! Only human beings invited!\r\n\r\nThis plugin works pretty simple:\r\nWhile messages from users on your contact list go as there is no any anti-spam software, messages from unknown users are not delivered to you. But also they are not ignored, this plugin replies with a simple question, and if user gives the right answer, plugin adds him to your contact list so that he can contact you.]

[Congratulations! You just passed human/robot test. Now you can write me a message.]

[StopSpam: send a message and reply to an anti-spam bot question.]

[If math expression is turned on, you can use following expression in message text:\nXX+XX-X/X*X\neach X will be replaced by one random number and answer will be expression result.\nMessage must contain only one expression without spaces.]

Example: Today is ?cdate(yyyy/MM/dd).\r\n\r\n!<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will not be parsed again. Example: Message waiting: !message(,first,rcvd,unread).\r\n\r\n%<field>%\r\nThis will parse the given field. Example: I installed Miranda at: %mirandapath%.\r\n\r\n`<string>`\r\nThis will not parse the given string, any function, field or special character in the string will shown in the result without being translated. Example: Use `%mirandapath%` to show the installation path.\r\n\r\n#<comment>\r\nThis will add a comment in the formatting string. Everything from the # character to the end of the line will be removed. Example: %dbprofile% #this is a useless comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Contacts ---\r\n\r\nWhenever a functions requires a contact as an argument, you can specify it in two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) Using a unique ID (UIN for ICQ, email for MSN) or, a protocol ID followed by a unique ID in the form <PROTOID:UNIQUEID>, for example <MSN:miranda@hotmail.com> or <ICQ:123456789>.\r\n\r\n(2) Using the contact function:\r\n?contact(x,y)\r\nA contact will be searched which will have value x for its property y, y can be one of the following:\r\nfirst, last, nick, email, ID or display\r\n\r\nFor example: ?contact(miranda@hotmail.com,email) or ?contact(Miranda,nick). The contact function will return either a unique contact according to the arguments or nothing if none or multiple contacts exists with the given property.]
